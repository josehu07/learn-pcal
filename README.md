First of all, what is TLA+ and why is it (becoming increasingly) useful? See Lamport's [official TLA+ website](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) for a good answer.

This repo contains:

* TLA+ video course solutions adapted from [Lamport's TLA+ video course](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html)
* PlusCal tutorial solutions adapted from [Lamport's PlusCal tutorial](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tutorial/contents.html)
* Dr. TLA+ lecture series material directly linked from [here](https://github.com/tlaplus/DrTLAPlus/tree/master)
* Dr. TLA+ series specifications cleansed and extended with PlusCal by me (WIP, ðŸŒŸ)

All PlusCal code in this repo uses the [P-syntax](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/p-manual.pdf) (instead of the [C-syntax](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/c-manual.pdf)). All sessions are made runnable with the [VSCode TLA+ extension](https://github.com/tlaplus/vscode-tlaplus) (instead of the canonical [TLA+ Toolbox IDE](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html)).

## Checking Finite-State Models

To generate a TLA+ specification from PlusCal:

1. Change directory into a folder containing specs
2. Open a chosen module file `*.tla` containing PlusCal code
3. Run the **TLA+: Parse module** command on this file
    * TLA+ specification code will be generated from the PlusCal comment
    * This step is already done for all modules in this repo (and should be done automatically on save by the VSCode extension for any file containing a PlusCal algorithm)

To let TLC check a bounded TLA+ model with parameters:

1. Open the corresponding model-checkable module `*_MC.tla`
    * Tweak model checking configurations, if any put in here, as desired
    * Define all the invariants and temporal properties to be checked
2. Open the corresponding configuration file `*_MC.cfg`
    * Tweak model checking configurations as desired
    * List the invariants and temporal properties to check against
3. Run the **TLA+: Check model with TLC** command on the `*_MC.tla` file
    * If everything goes well, a model-checking result panel should appear at side

## General Proofs w/ TLAPS

TLAPS is a new addition to TLA+ using SMT solvers to support general, possibly unbounded-state theorem proving. The VSCode extension currently does not offer TLAPS integration (see progress [here](https://github.com/tlaplus/vscode-tlaplus/issues/153)). Also, there is no official tutorial about TLAPS that is complete and publicly available right now. New things might be added to this repo as TLAPS becomes increasingly mature.
